It's main task is to quickly and conveniently change the Pivot Orientation, Origin and 3D Cursor positions by pressing fewer keys, eliminating the need to select the desired component of a mesh, bone or curve point and long travel through different menus to change Blender pivot. Just press D button, hover cursor mouse above highlighted component and click LMB, MMB or RMB to change pivot. Or use Pivot gizmo to move Origin in 3D space or set custom pivot orientation. Both are with incremental system. In addition Bbox gizmo helps adjust Origin and 3D cursor selected object's boundaries. It\u2019s available on Gumroad Blender Market ! Video Intro ! Current version update's video Features Easy change Pivot orientations. Easy change Origin positions. Easy change 3D Cursor orientation and position. Requirements Blender 4.2 or higher. Latest version The latest version of Friendly Pivot Addon is 0.5.0 . Installation It's recommended to remove previously installed addon before the installation! From \"Get Extension\" Preference tab Start Blender, then Edit \u2192 User Preferences \u2192 Get Extensions tab, Press 'Install from Disk' command in Extension settings dropdown menu (down-arrow icon located in upper right area of Get Extensions tab), Locate and select downloaded friendly_pivot zip file, Activate the addon, save user settings , Close preferences.

Quick usage Select object, press D (default invoke key, changeable ) or activate Friendly Pivot Tool in Blender toolbar then hover mouse cursor above necessary and highlighted component then: * Press LMB to set new Pivot Transform Orientation or * Press RMB to set new Origin position or * Press MMB to set 3d Cursor orientation and position. For more actions and modes see the addon's manual. Contact The addon is in BETA and works well but could be errors. If there is an existed one, please report a bug by pressing Support button in dropdown menu(upper left FP icon) while Friendly Pivot addon is active in main Blender viewport.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#friendly-pivot-addon-documentation","text":"Friendly Pivot addon mimics most functionalities of Autodesk Maya Pivot Transform tool with minor differences, improvements and updates suitable for Blender.

Tool header area breakdown Help menu & Status Bar This menu icon contains Manual, Support buttons, Shortcuts memo(switched off by default) and addon version number.

Also while FP is active Status Bar shows main shortcuts too. Gizmos Preview Switch icon . Default shortcut - 'P' . This gizmo shows highlighted component's normal orientation. It works with Mesh, Armature and Curve modes. Pivot This gizmo gives ability to set Orientation and Origin freely. Supports any Blender object type. Dial(Orientation) and Arrows(Origin) controls can be shown together or separate by switching these icons. Other way is pressing O (Orientation) or I (Origin) shortcuts. There is a value counting Pivot's distance( 'D + axis' ) when dragging the gizmo or current rounded value( 'V + axis' ) when rounding value. Pressing Alt while dragging rounds current axis value to whole number. Alt + Shift combination rounds value to first decimal value for better accuracy. For Dial Pivot gizmo value is being round to nearest whole number automatic(if 1.45 => 1.0, if 1.55 => 2.0). Current rounded value is being display in the left bottom corner with V character. Press Shift , Ctrl or Shift+Crtl - Activate incremental system for current axis while dragging pivot gizmo. Bounding Box With this gizmo user can set 3D Cursor or Origin to bounding box points around selected object. To activate Bbox gizmo press B key or use this icon in top tool header. To select desire object press LMB on it while bbox is activeThis selection works only for mesh type objects for now. Other type objects like bones, curves need to be selected before addon invoked. There are two transform spaces: world(default) and local. Local can be switched on by rotated box icon that is active while Bbox gizmo is on. !WARNING - World space is heavy calculation with hipoly meshes Modes Addons modes were designed to differentiate some Blender object types and work with them separately. Current version of the tool contains 3 modes: Mesh, Armature and Curves. They all works in local view but only with selected objects instead of basic view where all visible objects can be raycasted by the addon. Mesh To activate it press icon or M shortcut. This is the main mode for the addon that filters only mesh type objects in a scene. Armature Main key is A or icon. This mode relates to armatures presented in a scene and can sample orientation and positions of head, end, in-between area of each visible bone. Curve Invoke key is C ot this icon. In this mode user can set mainly 3D Cursor, Origin and Orientation(only with Aim and/or Multiselect modes) to curve's points. Additional Modes These modes extend basic addon functionality by ability to sample more than one component and get their average orientation and position in a scene or change addon's behavior to rotating pivot to highlighted components instead of sampling local normals. Multiselect This mode designed to set Orientation, 3D Cursor and Origin between selected components of one object or multi ones by averaging selected components orientations and positions. To activate use S key or icon. To conform selection - press them again. To select components user can use any mouse action(LMB,MMB,RMB) but only last action is used to execute certain type of conform. For example if last action was LMB the addon would set Orientation as main conform with respect of active combos. Basic shortcuts: * Press S - To activate multi selection. * LMB , MMB , RMB - Select components * Press S - To exit from the mode with or without comforms if no selected components * Press R - Deselect all components. Aim To Component X shortcut or this left icon switch on/off the mode that changes default orientation conform to aiming from existed pivot position to highlighted component or multiselected components' center by default X axis. Axis can be selected from dropdown menu while Aim mode is active. Also aim mode works with multiselect one. Combos Active combos simplify few conforms to one action and can be controlled from top tool header icons or shortcuts: * Q - Orientation combo On/Off * W - 3D Cursor combo On/Off * E - Origin combo On/Off Options menu Drop-down menu button contains some additional control options that have no shortcuts and can be activated when the addon performs conform: Set SCPO To Transform Tools - Every Blender tool like Move, Rotate, Scale and Transform has its own active orientation slot.
